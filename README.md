# Destiny-Excel-Collection
Scripts within this repository allow the user to export a text file of their gear in Destiny to a comma delimited text file.

1. This will only work with Chrome (Windows tested only)
2. You will first want to install Destiny Item Manager (DIM) onto your computer if you haven't already.

3. Once installed, open DIM and sign in through PSN or XBL
4. Goto the text file exporting script here: https://github.com/knuxem95/Destiny-Excel-Collection/blob/master/DIM-Weapon%26ArmorExport.js and copy the entire thing to your clipboard. 
5. Go back to the DIM tab and press F12 (Windows).
6. Click on "Sources" then "Snippets". Right-click and select New.
7. You may name this whatever you'd like then paste the code you copied earlier into the window.
8. Right click on the name you gave the script (above the code, not to the side) and click on Save.
9. Now right click on the script name to the left of the code and select Run.
10. This should produce a large chunk of text that is comma delimited.
11. Select all of this text and copy it into a Notepad file.
12. Save this notepad file as a text file, probably in a easy to reach place like your Desktop.

With the text file in hand, you just need to click the button in the Excel workbook and it'll do the rest! Message me on Reddit at MasterEmerald if you have any questions.
